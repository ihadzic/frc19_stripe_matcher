Matlab model of the position estimation algorithm for FRC Deep Space
2019 game using reflective-stripe guides placed at the walls
of the rocket, cargo ship, and loading area.

Quick example:

[x, y, d]  = sim_estimation(1, 1.542, 0.792, 55, 77, 1, 0.1, 2.5, 0.01, 0.05, false, true)

Type 'help sim_estimation' (in Matlab) for details.
